# DRep Code of Conduct Version 2

The following policies were established for the creation of this document:

Values, not rules: We aim to present desirable values for resilient governance rather than merely establishing minimum rules.
This document has been established and formed based on the values of immutability, resilience, transparency, security, and, finally, the accountability of the users of the blockchain for everyone's long-term benefit.
We are first given our considered values and examples of how such a value-based approach could be solved for the individual DRep. 

Erring on the side of freedom: Allow DRep freedom whenever possible.
However, we have to make a choice in how we give examples of implementing values.
The practical selection would ideally comprise risk assessment interoperate with the chance of erring on the side of freedom.
This is also important in terms of flexibility.
Allow for some flexibility in the requirements to accommodate different types and sizes of DReps and potential changes in Cardano ecosystem over time.

Not obligatory: As decentralization contribution and feedback collection.
Hence, this document is not intended to bind nor be a completed and unique guide as a DRep Code of Conduct, but rather to serve as a valuable guideline for confirming and insisting to the delegate that he/she is a suitable DRep.
