# drep-code-of-conduct

History:

The original Code of Conduct.
The Delegated Representative (DRep) Code of Conduct has a history back to an original DRep Code of Conduct for the Catalyst Program back in November 2022 by community member Yuta. Version V1.1 of this Code of Conduct was published in December 2022 and involved several Cardano community members. 

The CIP 1694 Code of Conduct
Since then a CIP 1694 Governance DRep Code of Conduct was initiated in a Catalyst Proposal, with the start of the work in October 2023 with workshops across the globe on 5 different contents in 2024 (Norway 20th January, Ghana 27th January, USA 20th February, Japan 21st February and Colombia 24th February) as well as online workshops. Cardano Foundation also sponsored a series of workshops in Tolouse (France) 25th April, London (England) 24th May, Oslo (Norway) 6th June and Las Vegas 16th August (USA). 

At one point the Code of Conduct was a 36 page document but it was refined down to the current 1 pager of items to make it accessible for all DReps who wants to use it and for the Delegators to quickly read it as well.

Current state:
With 10 physical workshops and several online workshops the code of conduct is at a state where it can be discussed even more widely through the Intersect Github repostitory. Ideally we will focus on refining the Code of Conduct in terms of universal language so it is a tool anyone across the world can use (See links for current translations) as well as adhering to its prinicples of erring on the side of freedom, voulenteering instead of enforced rules and focusing on the values we all adhere to instead of strict rules. 

To further the Code of Conduct it is recommended we work together in a Github Repostiory. The Code of Conduct is at this point ready for further refinement from the wider Cardano community.
